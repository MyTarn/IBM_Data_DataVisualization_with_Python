# IBM Data Visualization with Python
This is a Data Visualization with Python Project (part of Coursera IBM Data Science Professional).

## Hands-on Assignment: Data Visualization US Domestic Airline Flights Performance

Instruction
- Created a dashboard using Plotly and Dash.
- Visualization types included: pie charts, choropleth maps, treemaps, line charts, and bar charts.
- Using Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Folium.


## Dashboard result

  1. Initially the dashboard will be empty

  2. Have two reports(Airline Performance and Delay Reports).

     ### 2.1 The Airline Performnance Report

- It has a treemap(Number of flights flying to each state from each reporting airline).
- Pie chart(Percentage of diverted airport landings per reporting airline).
- Map(Number of flights flying from each state).
- Bar chart(Number of flights under different cancellation categories).
- Line chart(Average flight time by reporting airline)

     ### 2.2 The Airline Delay Report

- It contains line charts showing average carrier.
- Weather
- NAS
- Security
- Late aircraft delay times
